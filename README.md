The attached file contains starter code for a class Building that you should use as a driver for the following set of classes.
Write a class Room.  A Room class contains
an int instance variable for the area (in square feet) of the room
one constructor that takes the area of the room as a parameter
an accessor, int getSquareFeet() that returns the area of the room
a mutator, setSquareFeet(int area) that sets the square feet of the room
an accessor, int getCapacity() that returns the capacity of the room.  The capacity is given by dividing the square feet by 9 (using integer division).
an accessor, String toString() that returns the square feet and capacity of the room.

Write a class Classroom that extends Room.  A Classroom class contains
an int instance variable for the number of chairs in the classroom
a constructor that takes the area of the classroom as a parameter
a constructor that takes the area of the classroom and the number of chairs as parameters
getter and setter for chairs
an override for getCapacity.  The capacity of a classroom is the number of chairs.
an accessor, String toString() that returns the square feet and capacity of the room as well as the number of chairs.

Write a class Elevator that extends Room.  An Elevator class contains
an int instance variable for the current floor of the elevator
a getter for floor
a constructor that takes the area of the elevator as a parameter
a mutator void up(int floors) that increases the current floor by the parameter
a mutator void down(int floors) that decreases the current floor by the parameter
an accessor String toString() that returns the square feet and capacity of the elevator, as well as its current floor.

Grading Elements

    Room, Classroom and Elevator each have the specified instance variables
    Room, Classroom and Elevator each have their specified methods with the exact names, signatures and return types
    Classroom and Elevator are subclasses of Room
    Classroom and Elevator exploit Room as much as possible
    No accessors modify object state
    Each class calculates capacity as specified
    The given Building class should be modified to work with Room and its subclasses
