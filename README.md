Final Instructions
After completing step 4, the basic functionality of the CarLot application is up and running!
After completing step 5, be sure to read the Final Submission Instructions below.
In step 5, you must make two enhancements:
Enhancement 1 - Change CarLot to Use Inheritance
The CarLot class currently has one attribute,  inventory, which is of type ArrayList<Car>. CarLot HAS-A ArrayList<Car>.

Change the CarLot class so that it uses inheritance instead of composition. In other words, CarLot IS-A ArrayList<Car>.  If required, modify the CarLotTester class as well. 
Hint: Remove the inventory attribute
Grading Elements:

    CarLot successfully uses inheritance
    The CarLot tester runs successfully
    CarLot has not attributes

Enhancement 2 - Student's Choice
After implementing the CarLot application, you have probably identified areas where the application can improve.  Implement at least 1 improvement in the CarLot class. Be sure to document the enhancement and identify the enhancement in your java code.
Enhancements that illustrate extra creativity and technical mastery are eligible to receive up to 10 additional extra credit points for the project
Grading Elements:

    Student's enhancement is clearly documented 
    Student's enhancement clearly improves the CarLot application
    The CarLot application continues to correctly function. If the enhancement changes the behavior of the application, the changes must be appropriate and correctly implemented
