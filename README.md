Start with the attached Course Class. Use an ArrayList to replace an array to store students. One of the goals of the chapter is to use ArrayLists instead of arrays.

You should not change the original contract of the Course class (i.e., the definition of the constructors and methods should not be changed, but the private members may be changed.)  When it states do not change the contract of the course class it means that you can change in internal workings of Course but to the testers and outside world it needs to behave the same.
