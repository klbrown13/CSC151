After completing Step 3, your CarLot application is up and running, but it cannot save any of its data! In step 4, you will add the ability to load and save data. 
Note: This step is NOT part of the Team Assignment and should be completed individually.  This step should not be submitted separately for grading, but instead included with your final project submission.
Requirements

    Add the method saveToDisk() in the CarLot class.  When executed, this method should save all of the inventory data to a .txt file named "carlot.txt"
    Add the method loadFromDisk() to the CarLot class. When executed, this method should load all of the data from the file "carlot.txt"
    Enhance the CarLotTester class to test the saveToDisk() and loadFromDisk() methods
    Add two additional menu items, "Save to Disk" and "Load from Disk" to the CarLotMain class
    Include a sample carlot.txt file in your final project submission.

Hints

    Refer to programming Lab 9A for background on reading/writing txt files
